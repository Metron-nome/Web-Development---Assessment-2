    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>You are like the night, with its silence and stars.</p>

    <p>The long wait finally ended with the Modulator's return. 
      As promised, they found their way back to the Black Shores. </p>

    <p>Though they had lost their memories, their choices remained unchanged—together, 
      they corrected Tethys's errors and restored peace to the souls trapped within the Necrostar.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>Yet, amidst the celebration, the Shorekeeper felt something more than just pure joy—there was an undercurrent of uncertainty.
      The paths that had been laid out by Tethys, by the Modulator, and even by herself, had reached their end.
    </p>
    
    <p> Where should she go next? As the other members reveled in their success, she quietly withdrew to the familiar shore.
    </p>

     <br>
     
    <p>The Shorekeeper wandered along the shoreline as she did so often before. This habit had formed while she waited for the Modulator's return. 
      Sleep held little meaning for her. Instead, she preferred to stay awake, observing the shore and remembering all that time had etched into it.</p>
            <br>

    <p>Tonight's walk felt much like all the others. Time in the underground seemed frozen, and the familiar stars above unchanged. 
      As the path before her stretched on and the waves lapped gently at her feet, she reached toward the unseen horizon. </p>

    <br>

    <p>Though she felt as if she were once again in a state of waiting, unsure of what to do next, she knew deep down that something had shifted.</p>

    <br>

    <p>The freedom to choose was finally and truly hers. She belonged in this world and shared it with that one person.
    </p>
          <p>"Fill it with all that you desire." "Fill it." "Fill it." "Fill it."</p>    
    <br>
    
    <p>The stars she once guided seemed to whisper to her, their silent glow urging her to step forward into the new beginning that awaited her.</p>
    
    <br>

    <p>Footsteps drew near, and the one who had walked with her from the very beginning appeared, ever attuned to her slightest emotions. 
      This time, it was she who decided to break the silence first.
    </p>

    <p>"My name... You once said we would have plenty of time to discuss it."
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
      "So, have you decided?"
      
      </p>

      <p>"Shorekeeper, that's my name. Not because I guard secrets or the shore itself, but because I'm the one who watches over the roving star."
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p>
        She paused and smiled gently.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
        "It represents all of me, past to present. In the future... I hope that in our story, I can be the shore where you find rest."
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
        "And..." she continued, with a rare hint of playfulness, "those melodies we played together—I've composed a piece from them."
        </p>
      
        <br>
        <p>
        "I've given it a name... The next time I play it for you, you'll know."</p>
